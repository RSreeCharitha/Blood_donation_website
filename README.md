# Blood Donors App
Blood is essential for surgeries, cancer treatment, chronic illnesses, and traumatic injuries.
Whether a patient receives whole blood, red cells, platelets, or plasma, this lifesaving care starts with one person making a generous donation.
So, we saw the need to develop an app to connect all the blood donors and collect their personal details like name, address, blood group.
One can also see which donors are up for donating currently and which are not.  Users can log in/ create an account update their details, 
and also update their availability status.
